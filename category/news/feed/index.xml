				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Manchester we celebrated our partnership with Manchester Museum, which will see the development of a new multi-million pound South Asia Gallery in 2020 – the first of its kind in the UK, and the British Museum&#8217;s largest partnership gallery to date. The South Asia Gallery is part of a wider capital scheme at Manchester Museum which will include a large temporary exhibition space, a new entrance and expanded public facilities. Its aim will be to tell the cultural histories of South Asia, developed in close consultation with local communities and the wider diaspora. As part of the partnership, several objects from the British Museum’s collection will be loaned to Manchester Museum alongside ongoing curatorial support.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;There&#8217;s a risk that the northern powerhouse becomes entirely about science, technology and engineering and it cannot be. It must be also about culture, about social sciences, about what matters to people and what changes their lives&#8217;<br />

<p>Dame Nancy Rothwell opened with a few words on the significant role of culture in the Northern Powerhouse, followed by a reminder of the close links between the roles of museums and universities – both homes to research, teaching, community engagement.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;We&#8217;re aiming to become what we call a &#8216;Museum for Life&#8217; – a museum which works with everyone from babies to the very elderly, and which addresses some of the big issues around intercultural understanding and sustainability.&#8217;<br />

<p>Next up, Nick Merriman placed the South Asia Gallery in the wider context of the British Museum&#8217;s long-running partnership with Manchester Museum, the cultural ambitions of Manchester city and Manchester Museum&#8217;s wider redevelopment plans.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;The museum, the civic space which belongs to everybody, is where traditions which are both particular and shared can be explored&#8217;<br />
</b>– Neil MacGregor</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629" src="/wp-content/uploads/Mcr-Museum-Citizen-63.jpg" alt="Mcr Museum Citizen-63" width="900" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/Mcr-Museum-Citizen-63.jpg 900w, /wp-content/uploads/Mcr-Museum-Citizen-63-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>British Museum Director Neil MacGregor reflected on the South Asia Gallery&#8217;s significance to the British Museum, noting it as the largest partnership gallery that the British Museum has embarked on to date. He added that these types of partnerships allow the British Museum to truly be a museum of the citizen, with a collection that is accessible to, and reflective of, the whole of the UK.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;The British Museums collection was founded in 1753 with the collections of Sir Hans Sloane and I always find it a matter of great pleasure that even in that foundation collection there were already contemporary South Asian items and Indian paintings in his original collection.&#8217;<br />

<p>Reiterating Neil MacGregor&#8217;s sentiments that the British Museum should be seen as a lending library for other museums and galleries, Richard Blurton, Curator of the British Museum&#8217;s South Asia collection, showcased a speculative selection of <span style="font-weight: 400;">British Museum objects</span> that could be displayed in the new Gallery – including <span style="font-weight: 400;">paintings from the major centres of Mughal power, Hindu and Buddhist sculptures, and rare Bangladeshi scrolls and textiles.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;The only time I was compelled to make an effort to go to a museum was if there was something that was connecting me to my culture – for me that would have been seeing the oldest Qu&#8217;ran or Indian artefact on kings and queens&#8230;it was about me wanting to go because there was something connecting me to the museum&#8217;<br />

<p>Next up, BBC b<span style="font-weight: 400;">roadcaster and journalist Talat-Farooq Awan noted that the new South Asia Gallery would help Manchester build connections with universities and museums in Pakistan, while also building connections with the 340,000-strong community of people of South Asian heritage in Manchester.</span></p>

<p>The final speaker of the day, Manchester University&#8217;s Deputy Vice-Chancellor, highlighted the importance of the South Asia Gallery to the University. Students and staff represent 185 different countries around the globe, he said, emphasising that there were few other places where one could experience, and come to understand, people from so many different cultures.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;Both the British Museum and Leicester Museums are fundamental symbols of what it means to be a citizen in the modern world, with a right to information and access to heritage through our collections.&#8217;<br />
</b>– Sarah Levitt</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah Levitt, Head of Arts and Museums at Leicester City Council, opened discussions with an overview of the <span style="font-weight: 400;">close partnership between Leicester Museums and the British Museum, highlighting key exhibitions, spotlight displays, community projects and training opportunities that have been developed in collaboration over ten years. </span></p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;Leicester is a very special place with an incredible range of modern communities. Arts, culture and heritage are at the heart of what we do in the city. They play such an important part in our day to day lives&#8217;<br />
</b>– Liz Blythe</p></blockquote>
<p>In her panel talk, Liz Blythe, Leicester&#8217;s Director for Culture and Neighbourhood Services, noted that the number of children being born in Leicester is growing, as are the numbers of young people moving to the city to work and study. Through that process Leicester has emerged as one of the youngest populations in the country, whose young citizens are crucial to the city&#8217;s future. A<span style="font-weight: 400;">s such many of the services of Leicester Museums rightly focus on young people.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;Objects have huge power to inspire and it&#8217;s important that museums create opportunities for young people to develop a connection with museum collections.&#8217;<br />
</b>– Joanna Mackle</p></blockquote>
<p>British Museum Deputy Director Joanna Mackle touched on the timeliness and importance of &#8216;a national discussion on partnerships&#8217;, referencing the recently published <em><a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/research/warwickcommission/futureculture/finalreport/" target="_blank">Warwick Report</a></em> and the first <a href="http://dcmsblog.uk/2015/09/share-your-ideas-for-a-new-cultural-programme/" target="_blank">Government White Paper</a> on culture in 50 years, soon to be released.</p>
<p>The British Museum&#8217;s partnership with Leicester has focused on object loans and spotlight displays, and Joanna Mackle highlighted the 17th-century Mughal jade terrapin, The Throne of Weapons (an artwork made from decommissioned guns in Mozambique), and the Sikh fortress turban as successful loans. In 2016, the partnership will continue with a joint  HLF-funded project called Object Journeys, connecting local young people with collections at the British Museum and New Walk Museum.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;Young people are 20% of the population but they are 100% of the future.&#8217;<br />
</b>– Tim Loughton</p></blockquote>
<p>Culture, heritage and archaeology are uniquely placed but &#8216;underestimated&#8217; ways of bringing communities together, old and young, noted Tim Loughton MP, Chair of the British Museum&#8217;s All Party Parliamentary Group in his talk. Loughton emphasised the importance of getting young people into museums early, to get them enthused and engaged with local and global histories from a young age.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;We need young people who come from outside the Museum to join boards like this, because they are the disruptors; they ask the questions. It&#8217;s extremely important. Otherwise, we become tombs of the past which have no relevance to the way we live now.&#8217;<br />
</b>– Bonnie Greer</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writer, broadcaster and former British Museum Trustee Bonnie Greer, said that as a child the museum and museum collections were sites for the questioning and interrogation of the world&#8217;s knowledge, something she wishes for young people today. Greer stated that museums should be disruptors, in the sense that collections should be constantly interrogated and challenged, by academics, teachers and above all by young people.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;Museums shouldn&#8217;t be telling young people about things, it should be teaching them and helping them to ask questions. We should be learning from those questions too&#8217;<br />
</b>– Susan Raikes</p></blockquote>
<p>Echoing Greer&#8217;s sentiments, Susan Raikes, the British Museum&#8217;s Head of Learning and National Partnerships, noted the importance of empowering young people to ask questions, make decisions and pursue their ambitions within museums. She noted the Museum&#8217;s continued commitment to creating spaces of autonomy for young people, at the British Museum and in partnership across the UK.</p>

<p>Questions from the floor:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;We live in a society where we are all told that society is getting older, but youth culture is very much evident. How do we get museums to engage with youth culture?&#8217;<br />

<p>Questions for the panel included how museums can engage with youth culture, how they can become safe spaces for young people, and whether museums should be more active in the digital spaces where young people &#8216;live&#8217; online.</p>

<p>The Norfolk Museum&#8217;s Castle Keep is currently hosting a British Museum spotlight tour of the Lacock Cup. In spring 2014 Norwich Castle was proud to be one of only six UK venues chosen to host the British Museum’s touring exhibition Roman Empire: Power &amp; People., which attracted over 65,000 visits. In return, fourteen items from Norwich Museums Service&#8217;s Iron Age, Romano-British and Early Medieval collections have been loaned to the British Museum for the exhibition <em>Celts: art and identity.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk Museums Service staff have been engaged in major discoveries which have transformed our understanding of early British prehistory. Deep History Coast, a new and exciting initiative in partnership with Visit Norfolk and Norfolk Trails, integrates some of Norfolk&#8217;s most significant archaeological sites together with museum collections.

<p>Following on from Nick Ashton, Dr David Waterhouse, Curator of Natural History at Norfolk Museums Service, gave an overview of the Deep History Coast&#8217;s public engagement programme.</p>
<p data-l10n-id="">Fossil roadshows have been taking place at key sites along the Deep History Coast since 2012  – these include lectures and workshops. &#8216;Collectors and people who walk on the beaches are our eyes and means for recovering a lot of this information&#8217; noted Waterhouse. &#8216;It&#8217;s really about educating the public about what&#8217;s on our doorstep, and if they find something, making them aware of what to do with it, where to bring it, how to record it.&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>&#8216;This is the long story of Celts and it goes back almost 2,500 years ago&#8230;&#8217;<br />

<p>Although the Celts are not a single people, a distinct race or genetic group that can be traced through time, the idea of a Celtic identity still resonates powerfully today, all the more so because it has been continually redefined to echo contemporary concerns over politics, power and religion. ‘Celtic’ is still a word that creates a sense of difference, but what began as a label applied to outsiders by the ancient Greeks has now been proudly embraced to express a sense of shared heritage and belonging. Reflecting a long history of regional difference and independence, Dr Julia Farley tells the story of the Celts through the incredible objects they made, and showcases a number of torcs – a universal symbol of Celtic identity – that feature in the British Museum&#8217;s new blockbuster show <em><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/celts.aspx" target="_blank">Celts: art and identity</a></em> .</p>

<blockquote><p><b>&#8216;Ten years ago Norfolk produced about 40% of all portable antiquities found in Britain. We still record over 15,000 finds in the county every year, more than any other county in the country and more than several put together.&#8217;<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) run by the British Museum has resulted in over 1 million archaeological objects and coins found by the public being recorded. In his talk, Dr Tim Pestell, Senior Curator of Archaeology, Norfolk Museums Service, noted that Norfolk has been home to some of the most remarkable finds recorded through the Scheme, with no other part of Britain matching the mass and quality of material seen in the region. Torcs discovered in Snettisham, Norfolk provide a centrepiece to the British Museum&#8217;s own Iron Age galleries and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exhibition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital technology has and will continue to fundamentally change the museum sector. In his talk Dr Chris Michaels, the British Museum&#8217;s Head of Digital and Publishing, noted that the sector is currently experiencing a second wave of what digital means in museums, powered by greater access to smartphones, which will soon outnumber the global population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following an overview of the British Museum&#8217;s recent work across mobile, social and big data, Michaels encouraged organisations to take advantage of the new possibilities that digital allows for museums to encounter and respond to audiences.</span></p>

<p>Dr John Davies from Norwich Castle Museums took the audience through plans to transform the keep of the 900-year-old building and recreate how it looked when it was one of the most majestic Norman keeps in Europe. The development, which is slated to become East Anglia&#8217;s most popular tourist spot, will bring 100,000 visitors to the region.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>What ‘added value’ does object-based learning bring to teaching? </strong>Share your thoughts&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Objectively speaking</em> is a free conference and debate that aims to explore the value and practice of object-based teaching. The event will be hosted at the British Museum on 4 April 2016.</p>
<p>Last year, the Museum worked in partnership with the Department of Education and 40 museums across the UK to develop <em><a href="http://www.teachinghistory100.org/about/" target="_blank">Teaching history with 100 objects</a> – </em>a rich online resource that unites collections across the UK through objects, information and teaching. The project, in direct support of the new curriculum in England, aims to inspire students’ interest in history.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-398" src="/wp-content/uploads/teaching-800x1132.jpg" alt="" width="655" height="531" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/teaching-800x1132.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/teaching-800x1132-300x243.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></p>
<p>The British Museum and TES also recently launched the <em><a href="http://www.tes.com/hugehistory" target="_blank">Huge History Lesson</a></em>. This ambitious initiative links the world’s largest network of teachers with museums around the country through a creative challenge designed to help students unlock the incredible stories to be found in museum collections.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-395" src="/wp-content/uploads/hugehistorylesson.jpg" alt="" width="655" height="368" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/hugehistorylesson.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/hugehistorylesson-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></p>
<p>Both of these projects are underpinned by the idea that objects can act as a gateway to learning, by developing skills of observation and questioning, as well as by making complex ideas relatable and enabling emotional connections.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-265" src="/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2015-11-06-18.28.05.png" alt="" width="655" height="439" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2015-11-06-18.28.05.png 975w, /wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2015-11-06-18.28.05-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></p>
<p><strong>Join the conversation and share your thoughts<br />
</strong>With the generous support of the Vivmar Foundation, the <em>Objectively speaking</em> conference aims to recognise the expertise and experience of museum professionals and educators across the UK and will seek to open up the debate on object-based teaching by providing a platform to share best practice and explore shared challenges.</p>
<p>The conference is free to all delegates, and the programme will be shaped by your contributions – the British Museum’s national programme is open to all suggestions, presentations, workshops and discussions.</p>
