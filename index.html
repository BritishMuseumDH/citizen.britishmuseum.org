              <p>Partnerships are fundamental to the vision of the British Museum as a national collection – a museum of the citizen, accessible to the broadest audience. Partnerships with 250 organisations across the UK make the Museum’s collection and expertise available to the widest possible audience.</p>
<p>How this is achieved was a major theme of 2014’s Museum of the future – a public discussion which asked big questions about the future, from how the building is used to how the Museum connects with visitors locally and internationally.</p>
<p>This year, Museum of the citizen explored in more depth how the British Museum works in partnership with UK museums and galleries, the value this brings to local communities, and what future partnerships might look like.</p>

As part of the exhibition, we have included a real archaeological Anglo-Saxon sword, loaned from the British Museum collection.<br />Having worked within the Staffordshire Hoard galleries for over three years I have seen first-hand how the Hoard fascinates people and captures their imagination. They are struck by the intricacy of the detail, the beauty of the designs and the sheer amount of objects.<br />One thing that makes the Hoard so interesting is the fact that the vast majority of it is made up of military equipment, a large number of which were decorative pieces of swords. Often, the twisted and fragmentary nature of the artefacts and the absence of any sword blades found in the Hoard can make it difficult for people to visualise the objects in their original context. Having a real Anglo-Saxon sword allows us to show people how these buckled and broken objects would have fitted together, it has become a valuable interpretation tool on the gallery. This really helps people understand what these objects would have looked like and how they would have been used, providing a compelling insight into the lives of these craftspeople and warriors from our distant past.<br />Anthony Crutch, Museum Enabler at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</p>" data-link-url="" data-link-text="" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2-2000x2000.jpg" data-modal-class="modal--trans modal--bg-img" data-modal="single" style="animation-duration:1s; animation-delay:0.5s;">

This partnered event offered a unique opportunity for<br />for the Museum of Lancashire to develop an exciting new relationship with the local Sikh community. I was brought in as an artist to facilitate creative work about place and identity with this community and as a creative consultant for the community gallery area of the exhibition.</p><p>As a collective we focused on ‘home’ whereby people of diverse age groups created their own individual house. I also was invited to photograph two Nagar Kirtan events that took place in Preston. This work, and further consultation with the local Sikh community members culminated in constructing my own creative response, an interactive educational artwork about the Sikh religion using a dollhouse as a symbol of a Gurdwara (Sikh Temple). The artwork was displayed alongside the community’s artwork during the exhibition. The interactive  artwork has been used in educational settings and proven to be an effective learning source. It will continue to be offered in the future to raise awareness about Sikhism. It was a privilege to work on this project.</p><p>Kate Eggleston-Wirtz<br />Freelance Artist</p>" data-link-url="" data-link-text="" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/4.jpg" data-modal-class="modal--trans modal--bg-img" data-modal="single" style="animation-duration:1s; animation-delay:0.75s;">

                          The final Museum of the citizen event was held at the British Museum. Chaired by Dame Liz Forgan and featuring author and playwright Bonnie Greer, the panel discussion explored in depth how the British Museum works in partnership with 250 UK museums and galleries, the value this brings to local communities, and what future partnerships might look like.                        </p>

The Moai Hava is part of the British Museum’s collection and is currently on long-term loan to Manchester Museum. It weighs 3.3 tonnes (including the base) and stands 1.56 metres tall. The head of the Moai Hava is tilted back and the chin is pointed towards the sky. The arms are thick and the carving shows the loin cloth or hami. </p><p>Moai were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around AD 1000 until the second half of the 17th century. When Captain Cook's crew visited Easter Island in 1774, William Hodges, Cook's artist, produced an oil painting of the island showing a number of moai, some of them with hat-shaped stone 'topknots'. Hodges depicted most of the moai standing upright on stone platforms, known as ahu. With the adoption of Christianity in the 1860s, the remaining standing moai were toppled.</p>" data-link-url="" data-link-text="" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/statue.png" data-bg="#fbaa54" data-modal="object" data-modal-class="modal--solid">

The back of the mirror is engraved with a stunning looped design which perfectly balances engraved motifs with empty space. This was a new style of Celtic art that developed in southern Britain as communities were coming into closer contact with the Roman world.</p><p>Metal mirrors with a polished reflective surface on one side and swirling Celtic art designs on the reverse were first made around 100 BC. Celtic art acted to mark out powerful objects in the Iron Age, and versions of these styles have been key to reflecting people’s identities right up to modern-day Britain.

Its size and quality make it one of the most important finds of its type in Britain.<br />It contains a mixture of different precious metal objects including coins, complete ornaments, ingots (bars) and chopped-up fragments known as hack-silver. It shows the diversity of cultural contacts in the medieval world at the time, with objects coming from as far apart as Afghanistan in the east and Ireland in the west, as well as Russia, Scandinavia and continental Europe.</p><p>The most spectacular single object is a gilt-silver vessel, made in northern France or Germany in around the middle of the 9th century. It was apparently intended for use in church services, and was possibly either looted from a monastery by Vikings, or given to them in tribute. Most of the smaller objects were hidden inside this vessel, which was itself protected by some form of lead container. As a result, the hoard was extremely well-preserved.<br />Among the other objects are a fine gold arm-ring, and over 600 coins, including several that were previously unknown or rare types. These provide valuable new information about the history of England in the early 10th century, as well as Yorkshire’s wider cultural contacts in the period. Interestingly, the hoard contains coins relating to Islam and to the pre-Christian religion of the Vikings, as well as to Christianity.</p><p>The hoard was probably buried for safety by a wealthy Viking leader during the unrest that followed the conquest of the Viking kingdom of Northumbria in AD 927 by the Anglo-Saxon king Athelstan (r. 924–939). This was a key moment in English history, with the whole of England brought under one king for the first time. However, the hoard provides interesting evidence that the process was not as smooth as the official record produced at Athelstan's court suggests.</p><p>The hoard was acquired jointly by the British Museum and York Museums Trust in 2009. It is currently on long-term display in Yorkshire Museum.</p>" data-link-url="" data-link-text="" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/coin.png" data-bg="#d9f0e4" data-modal="object" data-modal-class="modal--solid">

Equally unexpected are the cone-shaped coils of beard projecting at a sharp angle from the head, and disconnected, upturned moustaches. Little effort has been made to distinguish the ears and nose, and there are no eyebrows. The mouth is a single, downturned line. These unnaturalistic features may be compared with some twenty heads of gods and mortals, cast in bronze or carved in stone at similar scale, which have been found in south-east England and northern France.</p><p>Through the Portable Antiquities Scheme, the bust was acquired in 2011 by the Ashmolean Museum from the owners, who had carefully kept it since its discovery after reporting the find to the landowner.

The copper-alloy coin, called a nummus, was struck in AD 332 at the mint of Lugdunum in Gaul (modern Lyon in France) and found in Seaton, Devon, near the previously excavated site of a Roman villa.</p><p>The coin shows the personification of Constantinopolis on the obverse and a Victory on prow on the reverse. This very common type was struck by Constantine the Great across the Empire to celebrate the inauguration of the new city of Constantinople, which was to become the capital of the Eastern Empire. The hoard is the largest of its kind found in Britain.</p><p>The recording of over one million objects on finds.org.uk since the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) was founded in 1997 is testimony to the enormous success of the Scheme, which allows finds discovered by members of the public to be recorded for the benefit of researchers and the public alike.</p><p>All the finds recorded through the Scheme have made a huge contribution to archaeological knowledge, revealing new insights into Britain’s past, from its earliest prehistory to the 20th century.</p>" data-link-url="" data-link-text="" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/mill.png" data-bg="#90cdd5" data-modal="object" data-modal-class="modal--solid">

                                          <strong>Future Curators and Museum Pathways</strong>
                                        <p>With the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund, the British Museum has been working in partnership with museums across the UK since 2011 to deliver Skills for the Future training programmes for a diverse range of participants.</p>
<p>Future Curators was a unique and exciting project which offered trainees the opportunity to spend a total of 18 months with UK museums, gaining in-depth knowledge of the museum sector and an accredited diploma in curatorship. From 2011-2015 a total of 15 trainees spent six months on placement at the British Museum and a further 12 months at a partner museum, working as a valuable addition and active member of both organisations.</p>
<p>The second project, Museum Pathways, provided entry-level vocational training in museums across Greater London. From 2014-2016 a cohort of seven trainees spent 18 months with a London museum and the British Museum, where they gained skills in practical collections management, care and access and worked towards a vocational qualification in Cultural Heritage. The programme was designed for people with little or no experience of working in a museum or archive, with the aim of providing them with the necessary skills to start a heritage career and make an informed decision about their future career direction.</p>

                                        <p>Virtual exhibits in the Google Cultural Institute detail Egypt’s history after the pharaohs, and show Celtic objects from across UK museums. We’ve also captured the whole Museum via Street View, meaning that if you can’t get to the Museum in person, you can do a virtual walking tour of every permanent gallery, and all its outdoor buildings.</p>
<p>‘The Museum of the World’ microsite features some of the most fascinating objects in human history. The interactive desktop experience uses the most advanced WebGL (Web Graphics Library) technology available, allowing users to jump back in time, listen to curators and connect objects across time and space. Best viewed in Chrome.</p>

                                        <p>Building the British Museum in the computer game Minecraft is an ongoing digital experiment. The idea was first announced in 2014 via a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2gg1ry/interested_in_building_the_british_museum_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit page</a>, inviting people to take part in the build. Since then, a global community has galvanized around the project, as people all over the world offer their building skills.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/the_museums_story/architecture.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fascinating architectural history of the building</a>, the build should represent something of a challenge for even the most devoted Minecraft players. However, with the project still in its early stages, the plan is to start small. Depending on how many people sign up (and their skill level), the project could potentially expand construction to multiple rooms, galleries and objects.</p>

                                        <p>MicroPasts is a collaboration between the British Museum and UCL that brings together academic researchers, volunteers and the public to crowd-source the recording of archaeological finds, history and heritage. Enthusiasts (of any background) can create high-quality research data together, and collaboratively design and fund entirely new research projects. These range from enriching old photographic archives, to creating 3D models of archaeological artefacts, some of which are available to download on 3D modelling site Sketchfab.</p>
<p>One of the largest pieces of Egyptian sculpture in the British Museum, this statue shows Ramesses II, who succeeded his father Sethos I in around 1279 BC and ruled Egypt for 67 years.</p>
